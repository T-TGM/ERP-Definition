            { term: "❄️🐇", definition: "This is a bypassed way of saying Snowbunny. ERP users will use this to evade bans." },
            { term: "🐂/bull", definition: "The meaning of bull is a sexually dominant male who, for fun or financial gain, cuckolds and humiliates husbands while servicing their wives. ERP's use the bull emoji since it means the same thing, but gives less of a chance of a ban" },
            { term: "Studio", definition: "Erotic roleplayers go on studio to attract other erotic roleplayers who play games (sexual adult games where you can have sex, with no chat/text filter) in Roblox Studio that are never published to avoid Roblox moderation. Although this is much less likely than the first one, it may be possible in some cases where it is clear they are breaking TOS or are associated with other TOS breakers. (This depends on user to user, when using this definition of the word make it exceptionally clear they are breaking TOS)." },

            { term: "Hung/hxng", definition: "To posses male genitals that are larger than average, espcially with regard to length, and especially with regard to the penis. Hxng is commonly used as a filter-bypass to hung." },
            { term: "Femboy", definition: "A femboy is a person, typically under the age of 30 years, who is biologically male. However, this person will often present himself in a very feminine manner. This behavior may be exhibited part of the time, or all of the time. This is also commonly used among ERP's to be quote on quote 'dominated' and femboys are 'submissive' in the ERP community" },
            { term: "Dih", definition: "Acronym for 'dick in hand', used to refer to something that's sexually arousing." },
            { term: "Good Time", definition: "In ERP context this is referring to sexual intercourse on the Roblox platform." },
            { term: "Personal Trainer", definition: "A term sometimes used in ERP to disguise inappropriate roleplay involving physical contact, dominance, or suggestive "training" sessions. It is often a covert way to introduce sexual themes while appearing innocent." },
            { term: "Cow", definition: "A bypass term sometimes used in ERP to refer to individuals in a sexualized manner, often implying themes of "milking" or lactation fetishes.

            { term: "Tight", definition: "A term frequently used in ERP scenarios to describe female genitals in an explicit manner. This word is commonly used in predatory or inappropriate roleplay and is a clear violation of Roblox’s Terms of Service as it sexualizes characters in a platform meant for all ages. The use of this term in usernames, bios, or chat strongly suggests ERP-related behavior." },
            { term: "Dom", definition: "A term used in BDSM and ERP communities to describe someone who takes control or exerts dominance in a roleplay scenario. The presence of this term on Roblox usernames, bios, or roleplays is a strong indicator of inappropriate or sexual behavior, as it refers to power dynamics within adult content. This directly violates Roblox’s Terms of Service and often signals predatory behavior." },
            { term: "Sub", definition: "A counterpart to 'Dom,' the term Sub refers to someone who takes a submissive or obedient role in ERP or BDSM-related interactions. This term is widely used in explicit roleplay communities and has no place on a platform like Roblox. Any usage of 'Sub' in profiles, usernames, or chats is a red flag for ToS violations and often ties to predatory intent." }

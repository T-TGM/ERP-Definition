        const definitions = [
            { "number": 1, "term": "ERP", "synonyms": ["Sex", "Erotic Roleplay"], "definition": "Erotic role-play (ERP) refers to sexually explicit interactions between users on Roblox, often conducted through chat messages or in private games. These activities can include detailed sexual descriptions, simulated intercourse, and suggestive behaviors, making them a violation of Roblox‚Äôs ToS. ERP is frequently exploited by predators to engage in inappropriate interactions with minors, posing significant safety risks." },
            { "number": 2, "term": "Roblox Condo", "synonyms": ["Explicit Game", "ERP Place"], "definition": "A type of user-generated game designed for explicit roleplay, often containing inappropriate animations, suggestive avatars, or bypassed chat filters that facilitate ERP. These games are deliberately created to evade Roblox‚Äôs moderation by remaining unpublished or using hidden access methods. Condos are hotspots for illicit activities, including grooming, making them a direct violation of Roblox‚Äôs ToS." },
            { "number": 3, "term": "MDNI", "synonyms": ["Minors DNI", "Adult Zone"], "definition": "An acronym for 'Minors Do Not Interact,' often used by adult users to indicate that their content is not meant for minors. While it may seem like a protective measure, in ERP settings, it is commonly used to signal sexually explicit conversations or roleplay, indirectly encouraging age-restricted discussions on a platform meant for children." },
            { "number": 4, "term": "Blue App", "synonyms": ["Discord Bypass"], "definition": "A bypassed way of referring to Discord, a popular communication platform frequently used by ERP participants to take explicit conversations off Roblox. The term 'Blue App' originates from Discord‚Äôs blue-themed icon and serves as a code word to avoid detection by Roblox moderators, allowing users to share links to external chat groups where rules are nonexistant." },
            { "number": 5, "term": "üíø/üìÄ", "synonyms": ["Disc Bypass", "Discord"], "definition": "These emojis, representing CDs or discs, are used as a filter-evading way to reference Discord. Since Roblox actively censors mentions of Discord to prevent off-platform interactions, ERP users use these emojis as a coded reference to direct others to external chat servers where explicit roleplay is unrestricted." },
            { "number": 6, "term": "‚ùÑÔ∏èüêá", "synonyms": ["Snow Bunny Bypass"], "definition": "This is a bypassed way of saying 'Snowbunny,' a term often used in fetish contexts to describe a white woman who is exclusively or preferentially attracted to Black men. In ERP settings, this term carries a strong racialized and sexual connotation, and users employ emoji-based substitutions like ‚ùÑÔ∏è (snow) and üêá (bunny) to evade Roblox‚Äôs moderation." },
            { "number": 7, "term": "üêÇ/bull", "synonyms": ["Cuckold Bull", "Dominant Male"], "definition": "A term from the cuckold fetish community referring to a dominant man, typically Black, who engages in sexual activities with the wife or partner of a submissive man (often referred to as a 'cuck'). In ERP settings, the bull emoji (üêÇ) is used to bypass Roblox‚Äôs chat filters while referencing this fetish. This term is highly inappropriate for a children's platform and violates Roblox‚Äôs ToS." },
            { "number": 8, "term": "Studio", "synonyms": ["Roblox Studio (ERP)"], "definition": "Roblox Studio is a game development tool, but ERP users exploit it to create explicit, unpublished games that never go public, allowing them to bypass moderation. These games serve as private hubs for sexual roleplay, with some even including scripted animations, private chat systems, and custom environments designed for ERP activities." },
            { "number": 9, "term": "Toy", "synonyms": ["Boy Toy", "Toyfriend"], "definition": "A term for a young man treated as a temporary source of pleasure rather than a serious romantic partner. In the context of ERP, this term often refers to submissive males who are used for entertainment or gratification without emotional attachment. The word carries connotations of objectification, emphasizing that the individual is valued only for their physical appeal or willingness to comply with another‚Äôs desires." },
            { "number": 10, "term": "ACED", "synonyms": ["Ace of Spades"], "definition": "'ACED' is a shorthand reference to 'Ace of Spades,' a term historically used in racial and fetishistic contexts. The 'spade' symbol has been used as a derogatory term for Black men, and in ERP circles, it is often tied to interracial power dynamics, objectification, and hypersexualization. Some use the term to signal a preference for Black partners, while others employ it in degrading or fetishistic ways, reinforcing harmful stereotypes." },
            { "number": 11, "term": "Homewrecker", "synonyms": ["Cheater", "Marriage Breaker"], "definition": "A 'homewrecker' is someone who deliberately interferes in a romantic relationship, often by engaging in an affair with one of the partners. In ERP and online roleplay, this term is used to describe individuals who take pride in seducing people already in relationships, sometimes as part of a dominant or manipulative persona. The term can also imply an individual who actively seeks out taken partners for the thrill of causing emotional or relational turmoil." },
            { "number": 12, "term": "Hung / Hxng", "synonyms": ["Well-Endowed", "Large Genitals"], "definition": "'Hung' is a term used to describe a man with notably large genitals, often in a sexualized or fetishistic context. The word is commonly used in ERP scenarios to imply physical dominance, desirability, or superior sexual performance. Because 'hung' is sometimes caught by chat filters, ERP users bypass it by replacing letters (e.g., 'hxng'), making it harder for moderation systems to detect. This term is frequently combined with other ERP slang to emphasize exaggerated male attributes in roleplay settings." },
            { "number": 13, "term": "Femby / Fem / Femboy", "synonyms": ["Feminine Male", "Submissive Male", "fembxy", "fxmboy"], "definition": "A 'femboy' is a biological male who adopts a feminine appearance, often characterized by androgynous or traditionally feminine clothing and behavior. In ERP, the term is heavily associated with submissive roles, reinforcing the stereotype that femininity equates to passivity or subservience. The word is frequently used in sexualized roleplay to describe male characters who present in a way that appeals to dominant partners, particularly in power-imbalanced scenarios." },
            { "number": 14, "term": "Dih", "synonyms": ["Dick in Hand", "Dick", "D!h", "D*H"], "definition": "A slang term and acronym for 'dick in hand,' commonly used to refer to male genitalia or sexual arousal. ERP users employ this as a bypassed way to discuss explicit content while evading chat moderation. It is often used in suggestive or sexual roleplay contexts, violating Roblox‚Äôs Terms of Service." },
            { "number": 15, "term": "Good Time", "synonyms": ["Sex", "Intercourse"], "definition": "A euphemism for engaging in sexual activity, frequently used in ERP to discreetly imply intercourse without using explicit terms. The phrase is often employed in roleplay scenarios where users imply or request sexual interactions under the guise of casual or playful language." },
            { "number": 16, "term": "Personal Trainer", "synonyms": ["Erotic Trainer", "Roleplay Coach"], "definition": "A misleading term used in ERP roleplay to disguise scenarios involving physical contact, body exploration, or suggestive 'training' sessions. While it may sound innocent, in an ERP context, it often implies guided sexual activity, violating Roblox‚Äôs ToS." },
            { "number": 17, "term": "Cow", "synonyms": ["Milking", "Lactation Fetish"], "definition": "A term used in ERP to refer to lactation fetishes, often tied to scenarios where individuals are 'milked' for pleasure. This fetishized roleplay is disguised under farm or animal-related themes, making it a bypassed way to reference inappropriate lactation content." },
            { "number": 18, "term": "Free Use", "synonyms": ["Always Available"], "definition": "A term commonly used in ERP communities to describe someone as perpetually available for explicit activities, implying unrestricted access to their body. This phrase reinforces non-consensual undertones and is a direct violation of Roblox‚Äôs ToS." },
            { "number": 19, "term": "Tight", "synonyms": ["Virgin", "Snug", "Unstretched", "Fresh", "Compact"], "definition": "A highly sexualized term used in ERP to describe female genitalia, often fetishizing youth, inexperience, or a lack of prior sexual activity. It is frequently used in roleplay scenarios where users attempt to create inappropriate or exploitative narratives." },
            { "number": 20, "term": "Dom", "synonyms": ["Dominant", "Master"], "definition": "A role in BDSM and ERP where a person assumes control over a submissive partner, often in a power-imbalanced or sexually charged dynamic. The term is commonly used in ERP scenarios to establish dominant-submissive relationships, which violate Roblox‚Äôs ToS due to their explicit nature." },
            { "number": 21, "term": "Sub", "synonyms": ["Submissive", "Bottom"], "definition": "A role in BDSM and ERP that signifies a person who takes on a submissive position, often allowing another player to control or dictate their actions. This term is widely used in ERP roleplay to create dominant-submissive dynamics, which are considered inappropriate and against Roblox‚Äôs ToS." },
            { "number": 22, "term": "Tyrone", "synonyms": ["Stereotypical Black Male", "Bull"], "definition": "A name often associated with racial stereotypes, particularly in fetishized portrayals of Black men. In ERP, 'Tyrone' is used to depict a dominant Black male involved in explicit scenarios, frequently linked to the 'bull' role in cuckold and interracial fetish contexts. The term carries strong racial and sexual connotations, making it inappropriate for use on Roblox." },
            { "number": 23, "term": "HMU", "synonyms": ["Hit Me Up", "ERP Invite"], "definition": "An abbreviation for 'Hit Me Up,' which is generally used to ask someone to message or contact the speaker. However, in ERP settings, 'HMU' is frequently used as an invitation to engage in explicit roleplay, directing others toward inappropriate private chats or external platforms for sexual interactions." },
            { "number": 24, "term": "BBC", "synonyms": ["Big Black Cock", "Black Wood"], "definition": "A highly explicit term referring to a Black man's genitals, commonly used in adult content and fetish communities. In ERP, 'BBC' is fetishized and often paired with racialized fantasies, making it both sexually inappropriate and racially charged. It is frequently used in chat messages, usernames, and bios to suggest explicit roleplay." },
            { "number": 25, "term": "Pounder", "synonyms": ["Aggressive Lover"], "definition": "In an ERP context, 'pounder' refers to someone who aggressively engages in sexual activity, often emphasizing dominance and forceful intercourse. The term is used to imply rough or intense sexual encounters, violating Roblox‚Äôs ToS when used inappropriately within usernames, bios, or roleplay scenarios." },
            { "number": 26, "term": "Thug", "synonyms": ["Rough ERP"], "definition": "While 'thug' traditionally refers to a criminal or gangster, in ERP, it is used to describe aggressive or forceful sexual activity. This term is often associated with violent and dominant sexual fantasies, particularly in racially fetishized contexts, making it inappropriate for a platform designed for children." },
            { "number": 27, "term": "Black Pole", "synonyms": ["BBC", "Black Wood"], "definition": "A highly suggestive term referring to a Black male‚Äôs genitals, commonly used in erotic roleplay and fetish content. This phrase is often incorporated into usernames, bios, or chat messages to allude to explicit activities, violating Roblox‚Äôs community guidelines." },
            { "number": 28, "term": "Punisher", "synonyms": ["Dominant Aggressor"], "definition": "In ERP, 'Punisher' is used to imply dominance and aggressive sexual behavior. The term suggests a person who 'punishes' a submissive partner in an explicit roleplay scenario, making it highly inappropriate on a platform with a large underage user base." },
            { "number": 29, "term": "Destroyer", "synonyms": ["Rough Lover"], "definition": "A term used in ERP to describe extreme and intense sexual acts, often portraying the participant as overpowering or 'destroying' their partner. This phrase is frequently used in a fetishized and aggressive manner, making it a clear violation of Roblox‚Äôs rules when used in usernames or chat messages." },
            { "number": 30, "term": "Edge", "synonyms": ["Edging", "Orgasm Control"], "definition": "A sexual practice where an individual intentionally delays orgasm by stopping stimulation right before climax. In ERP, 'edging' is often referenced in roleplay scenarios involving prolonged arousal. The term is inappropriate for a child-friendly platform and is commonly used in chat messages or private ERP discussions." },
            { "number": 31, "term": "Goon", "synonyms": ["Masturbation Obsession"], "definition": "A slang term referring to obsessive or compulsive masturbation, often involving extended periods of self-stimulation. In ERP communities, 'gooning' is discussed in the context of excessive pleasure-seeking behaviors. The term is inappropriate for Roblox and is often used in bypassed forms to evade moderation." },
            { "number": 32, "term": "Bunny", "synonyms": ["Snow Bunny"], "definition": "A shorthand or alternative way of saying 'Snow Bunny.' In ERP and fetish communities, this term is used to refer to a white woman who prefers Black men, often in a sexualized context. It is sometimes incorporated into usernames or bios to discreetly indicate racial fetish interests." },
            { "number": 33, "term": "‚ô†Ô∏è", "synonyms": ["Spade", "Racial Fetish"], "definition": "The spade symbol (‚ô†Ô∏è) is frequently used in ERP communities as a coded reference to racial fetishization, particularly involving Black men. It is often associated with terms like 'Queen of Spades' (QOS), which fetishizes interracial relationships in a degrading manner. This symbol‚Äôs use in bios, display names, or chat messages typically signifies inappropriate content that violates Roblox's community guidelines." },
            { "number": 34, "term": "Breeder", "synonyms": ["Impregnation Roleplay"], "definition": "A term used in ERP to describe someone engaging in impregnation fantasies or dominant reproductive roleplay.

This term is highly explicit and inappropriate for use on a child-friendly platform." },
            { "number": 35, "term": "Yoga Instructor", "synonyms": ["ERP Trainer"], "definition": "A seemingly innocent phrase that, in ERP circles, is used to disguise dominant-submissive roleplay scenarios. 'Yoga Instructor' often implies a role where one participant is 'training' another through suggestive or intimate interactions. This bypassed term violates Roblox‚Äôs ToS when used inappropriately in usernames, bios, or chat messages." },
            { "number": 36, "term": "Snowplower", "synonyms": ["Interracial Roleplay"], "definition": "A fetishized term referring to someone, usually a Black man, who seeks out sexual encounters with white individuals. This term is rooted in racialized fantasies and is commonly used in ERP to promote explicit interracial roleplay. It is inappropriate and violates Roblox‚Äôs policies on racial and sexual content." },
            { "number": 37, "term": "Whitecake", "synonyms": ["Interracial Fetish"], "definition": "A racially fetishizing term used in ERP communities to refer to a sexual preference for white individuals. This phrase is often used in a demeaning manner, emphasizing racial objectification rather than genuine attraction.

The term 'Huge Man' is often incorporated into display names, bios, or chat messages to signal sexual dominance. Since direct references to genital size are against Roblox‚Äôs rules, users often alter the spelling (e.g., 'Hxge Man' or 'HgeMan') to bypass filters, making it a clear indicator of ERP behavior." },
            { "number": 39, "term": "Trade", "synonyms": ["Pic Trade", "Nude Swap", "N*de Trade", "Exch", "Pxt", "Xchange", "Swap Pics"], "definition": "A term used in ERP to refer to the exchange of explicit images, often involving the trading of nudes.

            { "number": 8, "term": "Studio", "synonyms": ["Roblox Studio (ERP)"], "definition": "Roblox Studio is a game development tool, but ERP users exploit it to create explicit, unpublished games that never go public, allowing them to bypass moderation.

            { "number": 9, "term": "Toy", "synonyms": ["Boy Toy", "Toyfriend"], "definition": "A term for a young man treated as a temporary source of pleasure rather than a serious romantic partner. In the context of ERP, this term often refers to submissive males who are used for entertainment or gratification without emotional attachment. The word carries connotations of objectification, emphasizing that the individual is valued only for their physical appeal or willingness to comply with another‚Äôs desires." },
            { "number": 10, "term": "ACED", "synonyms": ["Ace of Spades"], "definition": "'ACED' is a shorthand reference to 'Ace of Spades,' a term historically used in racial and fetishistic contexts. The 'spade' symbol has been used as a derogatory term for Black men, and in ERP circles, it is often tied to interracial power dynamics, objectification, and hypersexualization.

The word is commonly used in ERP scenarios to imply physical dominance, desirability, or superior sexual performance. Because 'hung' is sometimes caught by chat filters, ERP users bypass it by replacing letters (e.g., 'hxng'), making it harder for moderation systems to detect. This term is frequently combined with other ERP slang to emphasize exaggerated male attributes in roleplay settings." },
            { "number": 13, "term": "Femby / Fem / Femboy", "synonyms": ["Feminine Male", "Submissive Male"], "definition": "A 'femboy' is a biological male who adopts a feminine appearance, often characterized by androgynous or traditionally feminine clothing and behavior. In ERP, the term is heavily associated with submissive roles, reinforcing the stereotype that femininity equates to passivity or subservience. The word is frequently used in sexualized roleplay to describe male characters who present in a way that appeals to dominant partners, particularly in power-imbalanced scenarios." },
